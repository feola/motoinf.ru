<h3>John Hammond - Driftin' Blues</h3>


<p>
 Well I'm drifting and drifting,<br/>
Like a ship out on the sea.<br/>
Well I'm drifting and drifting,<br/>
Like a ship out on the sea.<br/>
Well I ain't got nobody<br/>
In this world to care for me.<br/><br/>

If my baby would only take me back again<br/>
If my baby would only take me back again.<br/>
Well you know I ain't good for nothin' baby<br/><br/>

Well I haven't got no friends.<br/><br/>

I give you all of my money,<br/>
Tell me what more can I do.<br/>
I give you all my money,<br/>
Tell me what more can I do.<br/>
Well you just a good little girl<br/>
But you just won't be true.<br/><br/>

Bye-bye baby, baby bye-bye bye-bye,<br/>
It's gonna be too late baby<br/>
I'll be so far away.
