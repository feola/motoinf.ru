<h3>Buddy Guy - She's Out There Somewhere</h3>


<p>
Standin' on the corner<br/>
Wait on my girl to come by<br/>
Yes standin' on the corner<br/>
Waitin' on my girl to come by<br/>
Yes I can see nobody's face<br/>
And I just gonna break down an' cry<br/><br/>

Well I know she's out here<br/>
On this street somewhere<br/>
Yes I know you're out here woman uh<br/>
On this street somewhere<br/>
Bye baby now<br/>
I found me a new little girl<br/><br/>

Yeah hug me baby and uh<br/>
Hear me call your name mm<br/>
Oh I know you hear me babe I<br/>
Keep on callin' your name<br/>
Well I didn't hear the answer babe<br/>
An' I don't seem to see a dog-gone thing<br/><br/>

I'll flag me a cab and I'll<br/>
Ride around all over town oh baby<br/>
Yes I'll flag me a cab and I think I'll<br/>
Ride around all over town<br/>
You know if I don't find you woman I ain't gonna let this<br/>
Cab here no more put me down<br/><br/>

So it's about four o'clock in the mornin' and I'm<br/>
Startin' to fall asleep ha ha<br/>
I tell the cab driver I just wanna<br/>
Find me somethin' to eat<br/>
I say I gotta find my woman<br/>
And I know she's somewhere somewhere<br/>
You know I'm gonna ride I'm gonna ride I say I'm gonna<br/>
Ride this ol' yellow cab
