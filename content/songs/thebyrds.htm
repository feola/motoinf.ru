<h3>The Byrds - Ballad Of Easy Rider</h3>

<p>
The river flows<br/>
It flows to the sea<br/>
Wherever that river goes<br/>
That's where I want to be<br/>
Flow river flow<br/>
Let your waters wash down<br/>
Take me from this road<br/>
To some other town<br/><br/>

All he wanted<br/>
Was to be free<br/>
And that's the way<br/>
It turned out to be<br/>
Flow river flow<br/>
Let your waters wash down<br/>
Take me from this road<br/>
To some other town<br/><br/>

Flow river flow<br/>
Past the shaded tree<br/>
Go river, go<br/>
Go to the sea<br/>
Flow to the sea<br/><br/>

The river flows<br/>
It flows to the sea<br/>
Wherever that river goes<br/>
That's where I want to be<br/>
Flow river flow<br/>
Let your waters wash down<br/>
Take me from this road<br/>
To some other town
