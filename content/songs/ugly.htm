<h3>Ugly Kid Joe - Jesus Rode A Harley</h3>

<p>
My superstars were laced up tight<br/>
And all the sinners were gathered in white<br/>
The pearly gates were opened up wide<br/>
And the Lord must have seen me with his big red eyes<br/>
So I stepped out to the clouds<br/>
The holy father was getting down<br/>
And as I ordered a round of drinks<br/>
He said I got a little story tell me what you think<br/>
Moses used to sniff the lines<br/>
Noah used to rock the boat sometimes<br/>
Mary used to get undone<br/>
Jesus rode a Harley Davidson<br/>
All the angels were gathered around<br/>
Leather boots and lace night gowns<br/>
And one started to kiss my feet<br/>
She said the Lord got a red light on at every street<br/>
My superstars were laced up tight<br/>
And all the sinners were gathered in white<br/>
The pearly gates were opened up wide<br/>
And the Lord must have seen me with his big red eyes
