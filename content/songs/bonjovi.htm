<h3>Bon Jovi - Wanted Dead Or Alive</h3>


<p>
It`s all the same, only the names have changed,<br/>
Every day it seems we`re wasting away,<br/>
Another place, where the faces I saw cold,<br/>
I`d drive all night, Just to get back home.<br/><br/>

I`m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride,<br/>
I`m wanted, dead or alive,<br/>
Wanted, dead or alive.<br/><br/>

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it`s not for days,<br/>
And people I meet always go their separate ways.<br/>
Sometimes you tell the day, by the bottle that you drink.<br/>
And sometimes when you`re alone, all you do is think.<br/><br/>

I`m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride,<br/>
I`m wanted, dead or alive,<br/>
Wanted, dead or alive.<br/><br/>

I`m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride,<br/>
I`m wanted, dead or alive,<br/>
Wanted, dead or alive.<br/><br/>

I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back,<br/>
I play for keeps, `cause I might not make it back.<br/>
I been everywhere, still I`m standing tall,<br/>
I`ve seen a million faces, and I`ve rocked them all.<br/><br/>

I`m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride,<br/>
I`m wanted, dead or alive,<br/>
I`m a cowboy, I got the night on my side,<br/>
I`m wanted, dead or alive,<br/>
Wanted, dead or alive.
