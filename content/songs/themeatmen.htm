<h3>The Meatmen - War Of The Superbikes</h3>

<p>
Wanna bark a saga of the night the bikes went wild.<br/>
Four husky gladiators suited up for a war self styled.<br/>
The Interceptor, Ninja and 1100 primed to score<br/>
But me and my Suzuki knew we had so much more.<br/><br/>

They thought it would be just another clandestine late night road
rally.<br/>
But it was the WAR OF THE SUPERBIKES.<br/>
Red hot pipes and rumbling high tech power plants inch up to the<br/>
starting line,
But when the dust cleared up on Devil's Backbone,<br/>
One man/one bike/one dream would scream across the finish line.<br/><br/>

I layed it down into turn one, cranked it down full bore.<br/>
With my air-cooled transverse in-line Four Stroke Four.<br/>
I knew the 1100 was the man to burn.<br/>
I ruled the straightaways, he had me in the turns.<br/><br/>

As they blasted out of the high bank<br/>
The Ninja smoked a clutch<br/>
"Only two to beat," he thought<br/>
As he laid it down to those greasy 'S' turns<br/>
In the distance those oversized Japanese leg burners sounded<br/>
Like some sort of mutated gigantic insects.<br/>
Three men on monster machines SHOT OUT OF GOD'S SLINGSHOT!!!<br/><br/>

The interceptor faded as we hit the hill W.F.O.<br/>
All I had to do was hold on, seven miles to go.<br/>
But there were red lights flashing, the cops were gaining fast (Screw
the cops!)<br/>
In our high-powered way awesome road-smoking 12 mile dash.<br/><br/>

The FJ 1100 made his move on the inside<br/>
As the speedometer bounced over the 100 mile-per-hour mark<br/>
But he got a little too deep in the curve,<br/>
and didn't see the pothole.<br/>
All he saw was a burning, hurtling ball of death<br/>
As he blasted off into cool night air.<br/>
Just him and his GS 1150.<br/><br/>

It's the WAR OF THE SUPERBIKES(3X).
