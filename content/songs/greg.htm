<h3>Greg Allman - I'll Be Holding On</h3>


<p>
I have lived my life my way<br/>
For tonight and for today<br/>
It's the strongest hearts they say<br/>
That always survive<br/>
I'm fallin through the years<br/>
As each dream it disappears<br/>
When the night is full of tears<br/>
I'll be holdin on<br/>
Now this life is instant black<br/>
But I won't be lookin back<br/>
The rain washed out the tracks<br/>
I'll never find again<br/>
I'm still reachin for the light<br/>
I'm still wearin out the night<br/>
And you know I'll be alright<br/>
I'll be holdin on<br/>
When I stand alone<br/>
I don't stand on memories<br/>
Of all the ones you've known<br/>
I'll be holdin on<br/>
I know how it is<br/>
I know how it will be<br/>
(When) All the rest are gone<br/>
I'll be holdin on<br/>
Well my life is made of sand<br/>
It flows right through my hand<br/>
Each day I make a stand<br/>
And I'll see it through<br/>
I'll be reachin for the light<br/>
I'll be wearin out the night<br/>
And you know I'll be alright<br/>
I'll be holdin on<br/>
When I stand alone<br/>
I don't stand on memories<br/>
Of all the ones you've known<br/>
I'll be holdin on<br/>
I know how it is<br/>
I know how it will be<br/>
(When) All the<br/>
rest are gone<br/>
I'll be holdin on<br/>
I know how it is<br/>
I know how it will be<br/>
(When) All the rest are gone<br/>
I'll be holdin on<br/>
I know how it is<br/>
I know how it will be<br/>
(When) All the rest are gone<br/>
I'll be holdin on
