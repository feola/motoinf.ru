<h3>Billy Idol - Speed</h3>


<p>
Running from the nightmare<br />
In the middle of the road<br />
Hell's no place for sleeping<br />
In a world beyond control<br />
Caught in the headlights<br />
Coming after you<br />
When I woke up this morning<br />
I had to do what I gotta do<br />
Blast me to Heaven for loving you<br />
Blast me to Heaven for loving you<br /><br />

Speed<br />
Give me what I need<br />
Yeah<br />
White lightning<br />
Let's speed, on speed<br />
On wheels, on wheels<br />
Speed<br />
Oh, let it bleed<br />
Yeah<br />
Greased lightning<br />
Let's speed, on speed<br />
On wheels, on wheels<br /><br />

I've seen a train full of pain<br />
On the edge of overload<br />
We're in Heaven, baby<br />
You are gonna implode<br />
I've got these crazy feelings<br />
That I can't explain<br />
I've gotta save you baby<br />
Or I'll die in vain<br />
Blast me to Heaven for loving you<br />
I said blast me to Heaven just for loving you<br /><br />

I said speed<br />
Give me what I need<br />
Yeah<br />
White lightning<br />
Let's speed, on speed<br />
On wheels, on wheels<br />
Speed<br />
Oh, let it bleed<br />
Yeah<br />
Greased lightning<br />
Let's speed, on speed<br />
On wheels, on wheels<br /><br />

Blast me to Heaven for loving you<br />
I said blast me to Heaven for loving you<br /><br />

Now I'm rushing on the run, yeah<br />
I wanna have me some fun<br />
I'll speed<br />
Give me what I need<br />
Oh, set me free<br />
Let's speed<br />
On wheels, on wheels, on wheels<br />
Said speed<br />
Oh, let it bleed<br />
Yeah<br />
White lightning<br />
Let's speed, on speed<br />
On wheels, on wheels<br />
Com'on<br /><br />

I said speed, speed<br />
Give me what I need<br />
I said speed, speed<br />
Give me what I need<br />
Alright
