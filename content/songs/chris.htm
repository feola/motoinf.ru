<h3>Chris Rea - The Road To Hell</h3>


<p>
Well I'm standing by a river<br/>
But the water doesn't flow<br/>
It boils with every poison you can think of<br/>
And I'm underneath the streetlights<br/>
But the light of joy I know<br/>
Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows<br/>
And the perverted fear of violence<br/>
Chokes a smile on every face<br/>
And common sense is ringing out the bells<br/>
This ain't no technological breakdown<br/>
Oh no, this is the road to Hell<br/><br/>

And all the roads jam up with credit<br/>
And there's nothing you can do<br/>
It's all just bits of paper<br/>
Flying away from you<br/>
Look out world take a good look<br/>
What comes down here<br/>
You must learn this lesson fast<br/>
And learn it well<br/>
This ain't no upwardly mobile freeway<br/>
Oh no, this is the road to Hell
