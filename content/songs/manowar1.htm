<h3>Manowar - Return to the Warlord</h3>

<p>
Now the time has come when all is said and done<br/>
We're back together on the road it's time to fly<br/>
No more time to wait you know it feels so great<br/>
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride<br/>
I ain't waiting to get old I'm runnin hot I'm never cold<br/>
Kiss my ass if you don't like me I don't care<br/>
I got my wheels I got my friends we're on the road again<br/>
We're all crazy gonna ride until we die<br/><br/>

Time to burn you losers better learn<br/>
No one controls our goddamn lifes<br/>
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel<br/>
We're here to burn up the night<br/><br/>

Losers try to put us down it's just another day<br/>
I got no money or big house just got life<br/>
I don't like to save it's more fun to spend<br/>
If you like metal you're my friend<br/>
And that bike out in the yard well that's my wife<br/>
Don't try to understand me my family never will<br/>
Had to punch my teacher out now he's chilled<br/>
I might stay in school or die in prison<br/>
Either way it's my decision one more beer and heavy metal<br/>
And I'm just fine<br/><br/>

Time to burn you losers better learn<br/>
No one controls our goddamn lifes<br/>
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel<br/>
We're here to burn up the night<br/><br/>

We are the undefeated we're not living in the past<br/>
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass<br/>
Feel the power of the wheel lets drink to riding steel<br/>
Livin hard and ridin fast<br/><br/>

Time to burn you losers better learn<br/>
No one controls our goddam lifes<br/>
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel<br/>
We're here to burn up the night
