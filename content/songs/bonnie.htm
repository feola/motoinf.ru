<h3>Bonnie Raitt - The Road's My Middle Name</h3>


<p>
I told you once the day we met<br/>
I wouldn't be your queen.<br/>
Your little darlin', sweet coquette<br/>
Just what my routine<br/>
You've been around enough to know<br/>
There's really no one else<br/>
When I hear that siren call, baby<br/>
I just can't help myself<br/><br/>

I gotta go<br/>
I hope you'll understand<br/>
I love you so<br/>
Want you to be my man<br/><br/>

I hear it callin'<br/>
Sound so sweet and plain<br/>
I gotta go, baby,<br/>
'cause the road's my middle name<br/><br/>

Well, it's hard enough to love someone<br/>
When they're right close to home<br/>
Don't you think I know it's hard, honey<br/>
To squeeze the sugar from the phone<br/><br/>

Guess the road is in my blood<br/>
'cause I'm my daddy's kid<br/>
Just have to learn how to let me go<br/>
Just like my momma did<br/><br/>

I gotta go,<br/>
I hope you'll understand<br/>
Oh, I love you so<br/>
Want you to be my man<br/><br/>

I hear it callin', baby<br/>
Sound so sweet and plain<br/>
I gotta go<br/>
'cause the road's my middle name<br/><br/>

Here it come<br/>
And it sounds so sweet and plain<br/>
I gotta go<br/>
'cause the road's my middle name<br/>
I gotta go<br/>
'cause the road's my middle name<br/>
Oooh, I gotta go, darlin'<br/>
'cause the road's my middle name
