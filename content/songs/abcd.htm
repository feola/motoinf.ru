<h3>AB-CD - Harley-Davidson</h3>


<p>
The tour is over and I'm goin' home<br />
Home to my baby, the bike of my own<br />
So good to hear her, so nice and so clean<br />
Hard to believe it, she's just like a dream<br /><br />

We're drivin' out to the countryside<br />
Buy a sixpack we've got the time<br />
I'm gonna tell my girl to move<br />
'cause I´ve got real love to prove<br /><br />

Anytime I wanna, everytime I can<br />
I'll escape on my Harley-Davidson<br />
Anytime I wanna, everytime I can<br />
I'll escape on the highway<br /><br />

Gonna get married as soon as we can<br />
When I tell the church, the shit hits the fan<br />
I'm gonna buy her all the gas she needs<br />
Fill her up with lve, burning on the wheels<br /><br />

We're drivin' out to the countryside<br />
Makin' love in the morning light<br />
Don't have to pray for her to stay<br />
'cause I´ve got my bike anyway<br /><br />

(Chorus)<br /><br />

Fire!<br /><br />

Plop!
