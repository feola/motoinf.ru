<h3>Metallica - Motorbreath</h3>

<p>
Living and dying laughing and crying<br/>
Once you have seen it you will never be the same<br/>
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems<br/>
Hard and it is heavy dirty and mean<br/><br/>

Motorbreath<br/>
Its how I live my life<br/>
I can't take it any other way<br/>
Motorbreath<br/>
The sign of living fast<br/>
It is going to take<br/>
Your breath away<br/><br/>

Don't stop for nothing its full speed or nothing<br/>
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way<br/>
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line<br/>
Sending the shivers up and down my spine<br/><br/>

Motorbreath<br/>
Its how I live my life<br/>
I can't take it any other way<br/>
Motorbreath<br/>
The sign of living fast<br/>
It is going to take<br/>
Your breath away<br/><br/>

Those people who tell you not to take chances<br/>
They are all missing on what life is about<br/>
You only live once so take hold of the chance<br/>
Don't end up like others the same song and dance<br/><br/>

Motorbreath<br/>
Its how I live my life<br/>
I can't take it any other way<br/>
Motorbreath<br/>
The sign of living fast<br/>
It is going to take<br/>
Your breath away
