<h3>Steppenwolf - Born to be Wild</h3>

<p>
Get your motor running<br/>
Head out on the highway<br/>
Looking for adventure<br/>
In whatever comes our way<br/><br/>

Yeah, darling<br/>
Gonna make it happen<br/>
Take the world in a love embrace<br/>
Fire all of your guns at once and<br/>
Explode into space<br/><br/>

I like smoke and lightning<br/>
Heavy metal thunder<br/>
Racing in the wind<br/>
And the feeling that I'm under<br/><br/>

Yeah, darling<br/>
Gonna make it happen<br/>
Take the world in a love embrace<br/>
Fire all of your guns at once and<br/>
Explode into space<br/><br/>

Like a true nature child<br/>
We were born<br/>
Born to be wild<br/>
We have climbed so high<br/>
Never want to die<br/>
Born to be wild<br/>
Born to be wild
</p>
