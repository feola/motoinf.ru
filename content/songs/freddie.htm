<h3>Freddie King - I'm Ready</h3>


<p>
I'm ready, ready as anybody can be<br/>
I'm ready, ready as anybody can be<br/>
Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me<br/><br/>

I got an axe handle pistol built on a graveyard frame<br/>
Shootin' tombstone bullets, wearin' ball and chain<br/>
I'm drinkin' TNT, smokin' dynamite, I hope some screwball<br/>
start a fight<br/><br/>

I'm ready, ready as anybody can be<br/>
Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me<br/><br/>

All you pretty little chicks with your pretty little<br/>
hair,<br/>
I know you think that I ain't nowhere<br/>
But stop what your doin' an' look over here,<br/>
I'll prove to ya, baby, that I ain't no square<br/><br/>

I'm ready, ready as anybody can be<br/>
Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me<br/><br/>

I been drinkin' gin like never before<br/>
I feel so good, babe, I want you to know<br/>
One more drink, and I wish you would<br/>
I takes a whole lotta lovin' to make me feel good, 'cause<br/><br/>

I'm ready, ready as anybody can be<br/>
Now I'm ready for you, I hope you're ready for me
