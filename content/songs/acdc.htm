<h3>ACDC - Highway to hell</h3>


<p>
Living easy, living free.<br />
Season ticket on a one-way ride,<br />
Asking nothing, leave me be<br />
Taking everything in my stride.<br />
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme,<br />
Ain't nothing I would rather do.<br />
Going down, party time -<br />
My friends are gonna be there too.<br /><br />

I'm on the highway to hell.<br /><br />

No stop signs, speed limit,<br />
Nobody's gonna slow me down,<br />
Like a wheel, gonna spin it.<br />
Nobody's gonna mess me round.<br />
Hey, Satan paid my dues,<br />
Playing in a rocking band.<br />
Hey Momma, look at me.<br />
I'm on my way to the promised land.<br /><br />

I'm on the highway to hell,<br />
(Don't stop me!)<br /><br />

And I'm going down, all the way down<br />
I'm on the highway to hell.
