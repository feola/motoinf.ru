<h3>Lonnie Brooks -In the Dark</h3>

<p>
I heard you was out, high as you could be<br/>
Kissin' another fella, and you know it wasn't me<br/>
That ain't right, no no no, that ain't right<br/>
What goes on in the dark, will soon come to light<br/><br/>

They say you whispered low, an' spendin' all of my dough<br/>
You told that fella things, you never told me before<br/>
That ain't right, no no no, that ain't right<br/>
What goes on in the dark, will soon come to light<br/><br/>

One of these days, just you wait and see<br/>
Baby you'll realize, the way you're treating me<br/>
That ain't right, no no no, that ain't right<br/>
What goes on in the dark, will soon come to light<br/><br/>
</p>
