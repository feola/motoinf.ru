<h3>Golden Earring - Going to the Run</h3>


<p>
I could bet on new-years eve<br/>
He'd call me up at night<br/>
From the other side of the world<br/>
Ed was always there alright<br/>
Ed's got the looks of a movie star<br/>
Ed's got the smile of a prince<br/>
He ride a bike instead of a car<br/>
I wanna be his friend<br/><br/>

Dancing in the living room<br/>
With the ladies so nice<br/>
Like a child with a wisdom tooth<br/>
He's just a friend of mine<br/>
Ed's got the rings and the colors<br/>
Ed's got the wind in his hair<br/>
He goes a riding with the brothers<br/>
He's got a fist in the air<br/><br/>

Going to the run, run Angel<br/>
Going to the run, run Angel<br/>
Well, heaven and hell came together that night<br/>
Only for you this time<br/>
Going to the run, forever Angel<br/><br/>

One summer at the festival<br/>
Holding on real tight<br/>
On the back of a Harley<br/>
He took me for a ride in the sky<br/>
Ed's got the looks of a movie star<br/>
Ed's got the smile of a prince<br/>
He'd ride a bike instead of a car<br/>
I'll always be his friend<br/><br/>

Going to the run, run Angel<br/>
Going to the run, run Angel<br/>
And his wings started to shine so bright<br/>
Like a fire in the night<br/>
Going to the run, forever Angel<br/><br/>

Going to the run, run Angel<br/>
Forever going to the run, run Angel<br/>
Well, heaven and hell came together that night<br/>
Only for you this time<br/>
Going to the run, forever Angel
