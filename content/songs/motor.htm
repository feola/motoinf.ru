<h3>Motorhead - Ace Of Spades</h3>

<p>
If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man<br/>
You win some, lose some, it's - all - the same to me<br/>
The pleasure is to play, it makes no difference what you say<br/>
I don't share your greed, the only card I need is<br/>
The Ace Of Spades<br/>
The Ace Of Spades<br/><br/>

Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil,<br/>
Going with the flow, it's all a game to me,<br/>
Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you,<br/>
Double up or quit, double stakes or split,<br/>
The Ace Of Spades<br/>
The Ace Of Spades<br/><br/>

You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools,<br/>
But that's the way I like it baby,<br/>
I don't wanna live forever,<br/>
And Don't Forget The Joker<br/><br/>

Pushing up the ante, I know you've got to see me,<br/>
Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again,<br/>
I see it in your eyes, take one look and die,<br/>
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be,<br/>
The Ace Of Spades<br/>
The Ace Of Spades
