<h3>Megadeth - Moto Psycho</h3>

<p>
Responsibility, an anchor around my neck<br/>
Dependability, made me a nervous wreck<br/>
Accountability, I live from check to check<br/>
Volatility, neglect and no respect<br/><br/>

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat<br/>
I hit the road to "I don't know" and<br/>
look for "Tough Shit Street"<br/><br/>

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train<br/>
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again<br/><br/>

Moto Psycho<br/>
Going nowhere everybody is a<br/>
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby<br/>
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour<br/>
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho<br/>
Moto Psycho<br/><br/>

You know you can't resist to tell me what I mean<br/>
You gave my mind a twist said that I was unclean<br/>
The actor runs the play and ad-libs in between<br/>
You're all that I resent my thoughts were so obscene<br/><br/>

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat<br/>
I hit the road to "I don't know" and<br/>
look for "Tough Shit Street"<br/><br/>


One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train<br/>
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again<br/><br/>

Moto Psycho<br/>
Going nowhere everybody is a<br/>
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby<br/>
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour<br/>
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho<br/><br/>

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train<br/>
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again<br/><br/>

Moto Psycho<br/>
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho<br/>
Going nowhere move it or lose it baby Moto Psycho<br/>
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour Moto Psycho<br/>
Where I'm headed I don't know but I'm shoving off and<br/>
I hit the road<br/>
Going nowhere every body is a Moto Psycho -<br/>
time and time and time again I'm a<br/>
Moto Psycho<br/>
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby<br/>
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour<br/>
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho
